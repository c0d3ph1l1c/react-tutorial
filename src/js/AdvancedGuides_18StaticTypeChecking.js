/*
    Static type checkers like Flow and TypeScript identify certain types of problems before you even run your code. They can also improve developer workflow by adding features like auto-completion. For this reason, we recommend using Flow or TypeScript instead of PropTypes for larger code bases.

/*****
    Flow
*****/
/*
    Flow is a static type checker for your JavaScript code. It is developed at Facebook and is often used with React. It lets you annotate the variables, functions, and React components with a special type syntax, and catch mistakes early. You can read an introduction to Flow to learn its basics.

    To use Flow, you need to:

    - Add Flow to your project as a dependency.
    - Ensure that Flow syntax is stripped from the compiled code.
    - Add type annotations and run Flow to check them.

/****
    TypeScript
*****/
/*
    TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a typed superset of JavaScript, and includes its own compiler. Being a typed language, TypeScript can catch errors and bugs at build time, long before your app goes live. You can learn more about using TypeScript with React here.

    To use TypeScript, you need to:

    - Add TypeScript as a dependency to your project
    - Configure the TypeScript compiler options
    - Use the right file extensions
    - Add definitions for libraries you use
